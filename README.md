# Utilities and Scripts

This is a collection of many small tools and applications I have written over
the years. Documentation is sparse and will remain as such, unless a project
evolves to the point that it needs more (though, at that point, it will most
likely get its own repository).

Most of the items here will be shell scripts (usually zsh), Ruby, and
occasionally Python.

## Support

Expect little usefulness and no support. Some of these may actually erase your
hard drive, and that may be the point.

## Licensing

The vast majority of the code here is stuff I have written off the top of my
head in the heat of the moment. A few things contain snippets copy/pasted from
forums or web sites. If a license was included with it, it will be in the code.
Otherwise, it is safe to assume one of:

1. I wrote it, and you can simply obey the `COPYING` file;
2. someone else wrote it, didn't include a license, and implied or outright
   stated anyone could use the code.
