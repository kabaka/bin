# Kabaka's Utility Scripts

As any long-time Linux administrator knows, many problems can be solved by
throwing together an ugly, custom tool that does exactly what you need and
nothing more. This is a small portion of my collection of the things I have
written for myself.

Expect little usefulness and no support. Some of these may actually erase your
hard drive, and that may be the point.

## About Licensing

The vast majority of the code here is stuff I have written off the top of my
head in the heat of the moment. A few things contain snippets copy/pasted from
forums or web sites. If a license was included with it, it will be in the code.
Otherwise, it is safe to assume one of: (1) I wrote it, and you can simply obey
the `COPYING` file; (2) someone else wrote it, didn't include a license, and
implied or outright stated anyone could use the code.
